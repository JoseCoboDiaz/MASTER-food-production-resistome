The submitted cdhit and phenotypes_20250421.txt were not from the same version of ResFinder database (cdhit.txt is the all.fsa version from the manuscript XXXXXX).

To prove the pipeline we recommend to use the last version for both phenotypes.txt and all.fsa files (https://bitbucket.org/genomicepidemiology/resfinder_db/src/master/) and take care about the possibility of some missing genes on phenotyhpes.txt file.
